| -------- | ----------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| High     | In Progress | Lint & Types | Add missing type annotations across scripts/tests | Continue annotating tests flagged by `ruff --select ANN`; unblock `mypy` expansion later. ✅ `tests/test_env_auth.py` fully annotated (2025-10-08). ✅ `tests/test_pip_audit_integration.py`, `tests/test_type_coverage_report.py`, `tests/test_update_changelog.py`, `tests/test_ux_acceptance_script.py` annotated (2025-10-09). |
| High     | Not Started | Lint         | Tackle remaining lint blockers                    | Address import ordering, redundant casts, markdown lint, and any new Ruff findings.                                                                 |
| High     | Not Started | Governance   | Blueprint Frontier Apex gates + GitHub Projects automation | Expand coverage target to ≥85, codify UX acceptance scripts, and sync Next Steps with Projects dashboards for executive reporting.                          |
| High     | Completed   | ADRs         | Complete all ADR follow-up tasks                  | ✅ All ADR-0002, ADR-0003, ADR-0004 follow-up tasks completed (2025-10-09): Release checklist created, environment variable docs added, Renovate integration documented, README updated with dev setup. |
| High     | Completed   | Supply Chain | Re-pin `.github/workflows/publish.yml` actions    | Restored `pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish` to commit `e53eb8b` and enabled Renovate digest pinning for the GitHub Actions manager.                      |
| High     | Completed   | Security     | Replace placeholder JWT signing                   | `_generate_jwt` now signs with PyJWT when available and falls back to a logged placeholder only if the dependency is absent.                        |
| High     | Completed   | Security     | Harden token caching                              | GitHub App tokens persist to the OS keyring (with encoded file backup) and legacy plaintext cache files are still readable for upgrades.            |
| High     | Completed   | Governance   | Frontier Elite quality gates (coverage ≥80, format, compile, governance validator) | `python scripts/quality_gates.py` + `python scripts/verify_next_steps.py` keep UX + GitHub Projects guardrails enforced in CI.【F:scripts/quality_gates.py†L21-L82】【F:scripts/verify_next_steps.py†L1-L33】 |
| Medium   | Completed   | Security UX  | Mask VS Code secret harvesting output             | `get_vscode_secrets` now redacts secrets by default with explicit opt-out configuration and regression tests covering raw and masked flows (2025-10-09). |
| Medium   | Completed   | Typing       | Ship `py.typed` marker                            | Added `src/issuesuite/py.typed` and updated `MANIFEST.in` to ensure type hints ship with the wheel.                                                 |
| Medium   | Completed   | Supply Chain | Pin build tooling in workflows                    | Workflow now installs `pip==24.2`, `build==1.2.2.post1`, and `twine==6.2.0`; evaluate adding `--require-hashes` once digests are curated.           |
| Medium   | New         | Testing      | Add security regression tests                     | Add unit/integration coverage for GitHub App auth failures, JWT validation, and token cache permissions.                                            |
| Medium   | New         | Tooling      | Stabilise pip-audit in offline CI                 | Investigate resilient timeouts/offline datasets so `pip-audit --strict` no longer hangs without network access.                                     |

## Notes

- ✅ **All ADR follow-up tasks completed (2025-10-09)**: Created comprehensive release checklist (`docs/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md`), documented all environment variables (`docs/starlight/src/content/docs/reference/environment-variables.mdx`), added Renovate integration guide (`docs/starlight/src/content/docs/how-to/renovate-integration.mdx`), and updated README with developer environment setup section. All ADRs (0002, 0003, 0004) now have complete implementation and documentation.
- Renovate is now configured to pin GitHub Actions digests. Consider adding a CI status check to ensure Renovate PRs for action updates are reviewed promptly.
- PyJWT and keyring are now optional auth dependencies; ensure production environments install the `all` extra (or a dedicated `auth` extra) so GitHub App sync remains functional.
- `sitecustomize.py` applies the resilient pip-audit shim automatically so hermetic `python -m pip_audit` invocations reuse the offline dataset and 60s timeout. Prefer `issuesuite security --pip-audit` for new automation.【F:sitecustomize.py†L1-L63】
- Curated security allowlist entry for GHSA-4xh5-x5gv-qwph expires 2025-11-30; track upstream pip remediation and remove once patched.【F:src/issuesuite/data/security_allowlist.json†L1-L13】
- Frontier Apex planning should involve PMO + UX leads; capture accessibility heuristics and Projects automation requirements alongside engineering tasks. Nightly dry-runs now publish artifacts via `.github/workflows/projects-status.yml` for review before tokens are granted.
- Projects sync CLI entrypoint restored with config-aware defaults and regression tests so automation can invoke previews or apply gates once tokens are provisioned; follow-up coverage on live apply paths remains outstanding.【F:src/issuesuite/cli.py†L189-L323】【F:tests/test_cli_extended.py†L394-L509】
- VS Code secret harvesting now returns redacted summaries by default; only tests and explicit scripts should request raw values via the new opt-out flag.
- Docs preview and deployment workflows are wired via `.github/workflows/docs.yml`; repository admins must enable GitHub Pages for the `github-pages` environment to complete deployments.【F:.github/workflows/docs.yml†L1-L63】
