# IssueSuite Documentation

> **Note**
> The canonical documentation lives in the [Astro Starlight workspace](starlight). The legacy Markdown tree has been retired to avoid divergenceâ€”browse the Starlight content directly when editing docs or run `nox -s docs` to build the site locally.

Key entry points inside the workspace (run `scripts/refresh-deps.sh` or `nox -s lock`
after Renovate/Dependabot updates to keep lockfiles in sync):

- Tutorials: `docs/starlight/src/content/docs/tutorials/`
- How-to guides: `docs/starlight/src/content/docs/how-to/`
- Reference: `docs/starlight/src/content/docs/reference/`
- Explanations: `docs/starlight/src/content/docs/explanations/`

Refer to `docs/adrs/index.json` for tracked decisions and keep `Next_Steps.md` updated with documentation milestones.
