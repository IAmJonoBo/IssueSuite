IssueSuite now ships with a tracked ADR registry. Follow this workflow to propose, accept, and supersede decisions.

## Author a new ADR

1. Copy `docs/adrs/ADR-0001-starlight-migration.md` as a template.
2. Increment the ID (four-digit, zero-padded) and update the slug, title, status, and metadata in `docs/adrs/index.json`.
3. Document context, decision, consequences, and follow-up tasks.

## Keep the index synchronised

Tests assert that every ADR listed in `index.json` has a corresponding file and vice versa. Always update both to keep CI green.

## Reference ADRs in documentation

Link to ADRs from tutorials, how-to guides, and explanations when they provide architectural rationale. This ensures readers understand why a workflow exists.

:::caution[Planned features]
We'll expose ADR metadata in the Starlight site once multiple decisions exist, including status badges and supersession history.

## Review cadence

- Mark `status: Proposed` while gathering consensus.
- Update to `Accepted` once merged.
- Use `Superseded` when a later ADR replaces the decision and link via `superseded_by` / `supersedes` arrays in the index.

Keep `Next Steps.md` updated with ADR follow-ups to maintain a single source of truth.
