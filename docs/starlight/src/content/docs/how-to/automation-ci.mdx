This guide outlines pragmatic CI/CD patterns for IssueSuite across dry-run validation, production apply gates, and release automation.

## GitHub Actions: Dry-run quality gate

Start from `.github/workflows/issuesuite-sync.yml`. The workflow below validates specs, runs a dry-run sync, and uploads artifacts for review.

```yaml
jobs:
  dry-run-sync:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v5
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v6
        with:
          python-version: "3.12"
      - run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install issuesuite
      - run: issuesuite validate --config issue_suite.config.yaml
      - run: |
          issuesuite sync --dry-run --update --config issue_suite.config.yaml \
            --summary-json issues_summary.json --plan-json issues_plan.json
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: issuesuite-plan
          path: |
            issues_summary.json
            issues_plan.json
```

Tips:

- Export `ISSUESUITE_AI_MODE=1` to enforce dry-run mode in forks and pull requests.
- Capture plan JSON to review proposed changes without updating local cache files.
- Forward `ISSUESUITE_PIP_AUDIT_DISABLE_ONLINE=1` when runners lack outbound internet access.

## GitHub Actions: Apply pipeline

Once the dry-run output is reviewed, trigger a separate job to apply changes:

```yaml
jobs:
  apply-sync:
    needs: dry-run-sync
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v5
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v6
        with:
          python-version: "3.12"
      - run: pip install issuesuite
      - env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        run: issuesuite sync --update --config issue_suite.config.yaml \
          --summary-json issues_summary.json
```

Follow up with `issuesuite reconcile` in a governance workflow â€” exit code `2` indicates drift and should block promotion.

:::tip[Planned features]
We're designing a Starlight integration that renders the latest coverage and reconcile status alongside published documentation. Expect GitHub Projects automation hooks once the ADR backlog closes.

## Release, packaging, and Homebrew taps

1. Tag a release using `scripts/release.py --patch` (or `--minor`/`--major`).
2. `release.yml` builds wheels, generates the Homebrew formula, performs `twine check`, and publishes via PyPI trusted publishing.
3. Run `scripts/homebrew_formula.py` to sync the formula into your tap repository.

For detailed maintainer steps see [Homebrew tap automation](./homebrew).
