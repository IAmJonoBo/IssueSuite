With Astro Starlight powering IssueSuite docs, we enforce the same Frontier gates used across the CLI. This guide explains how to run doc builds locally and in CI.

## Local workflow

```bash
cd docs/starlight
npm install
npm run check
npm run build
```

The `check` script executes `astro check --flags minimal` to lint Markdown, validate frontmatter, and ensure links stay healthy.

## Nox session

Run `nox -s docs` to install dependencies (cached per session) and perform `npm run check && npm run build`. The session exits non-zero if either step fails, keeping documentation within release readiness criteria.

## CI integration

Add a job to your workflow:

```yaml
jobs:
  docs:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v5
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
          cache: 'npm'
          cache-dependency-path: docs/starlight/package-lock.json
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
        working-directory: docs/starlight
      - name: Build documentation
        run: npm run build
        working-directory: docs/starlight
```

:::note[Planned features]
A future enhancement will publish the built site to GitHub Pages and surface build status in the Projects dashboard alongside IssueSuite's quality gates.

## Quality expectations

- Every page includes `title`, `description`, and Di√°taxis category metadata.
- Tests in `tests/test_documentation_structure.py` guard against missing frontmatter and unsynchronised ADR entries.
- `Next Steps.md` tracks documentation milestones so we continuously evolve governance.
