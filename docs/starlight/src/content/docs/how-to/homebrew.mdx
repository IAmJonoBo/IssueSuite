Homebrew distribution keeps IssueSuite accessible to operators who prefer package managers. This guide outlines our maintainer workflow.

## Release flow

1. Tag the release with `scripts/release.py` (choose `--patch`, `--minor`, or `--major`).
2. The `release.yml` workflow builds wheels, runs `twine check`, and generates a Homebrew formula.
3. Run `scripts/homebrew_formula.py` to sync the formula into your tap repository.
4. Validate with `brew install --build-from-source issuesuite` before publishing.

## Formula configuration

The generated formula pins dependencies, verifies the SHA256, and exposes CLI entry points. Re-run the helper script whenever packaging metadata changes.

:::note[Planned features]
We're expanding the release helper to publish a documentation changelog entry and trigger Astro builds automatically when a new version is tagged.

## Troubleshooting

- **Checksum mismatch**: Regenerate artifacts locally and re-run the release script to capture updated hashes.
- **Bumped Python version**: Update the formula's `depends_on "python@<version>"` line, regenerate, and validate on macOS runners.
- **Tap CI failures**: Ensure `brew test-bot` runs as part of your tap's workflow; IssueSuite's formula includes integration tests to catch CLI regressions.
