IssueSuite delivers declarative GitHub Issues automation, resilient quality gates, and telemetry that makes roadmap health observable at a glance.

## Why Starlight?

We now publish IssueSuite documentation through **Astro Starlight**, enabling fast search, responsive layouts, and automated quality gates over every Markdown page.

:::tip[Planned features]
Upcoming releases will embed API reference snapshots and live quality gate dashboards directly within the Starlight site once GitHub Projects automation ships.

## Documentation pillars

- **Tutorials** walk newcomers from installation to their first sync.
- **How-to guides** focus on concrete tasks like wiring CI or curating ADRs.
- **Reference** documents CLI commands, configuration schemas, and telemetry payloads.
- **Explanations** provide architectural rationale, governance strategy, and deep dives.
