IssueSuite publishes versioned JSON Schemas via `issuesuite schema` and `issuesuite ai-context`. Consumers can validate automation payloads without reverse-engineering the CLI.

## Export schema

`issuesuite schema --stdout --export` prints the issue export schema. Use it to validate integrations that consume `issues_export.json`.

## Summary schema

`issuesuite schema --stdout --summary` emits the plan summary schema. CI systems can assert plan shape before applying changes.

## AI context schema

`issuesuite ai-context --schema-json ai_context.schema.json` writes the structure assistants expect when ingesting project state.

:::tip[Planned features]
Nightly builds will soon update a public schema registry and embed diffs directly into Starlight reference pages.

Refer to `src/issuesuite/schema_registry.py` for version history and to `scripts/coverage_trends.py` for telemetry payload exports.
