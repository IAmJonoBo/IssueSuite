IssueSuite publishes versioned JSON Schemas via `issuesuite schema` and `issuesuite ai-context`. Consumers can validate automation payloads without reverse-engineering the CLI.

## Export schema

Run `issuesuite schema` to write the export schema to the path configured by `schema_export_file` (default `issue_export.schema.json`). Use it to validate integrations that consume `issues_export.json`.

## Summary schema

The same command writes the summary schema to `schema_summary_file` (default `issue_change_summary.schema.json`). CI systems can assert plan shape before applying changes.

## AI context schema

When AI context support is available, `issuesuite schema` also persists an AI context schema to `schema_ai_context_file` (default `ai_context.schema.json`). Pair it with `issuesuite ai-context --output ai_context.json` to capture real payloads for assistants.

:::tip[Planned features]
Nightly builds will soon update a public schema registry and embed diffs directly into Starlight reference pages.

Refer to `src/issuesuite/schema_registry.py` for version history and to `scripts/coverage_trends.py` for telemetry payload exports.
