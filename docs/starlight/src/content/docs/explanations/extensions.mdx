IssueSuite ships optional hooks so teams can observe CLI usage and run custom logic after each command.

## Plugin entry points

- Entry point group: `issuesuite.plugins`.
- Plugins receive a `PluginContext` containing the command name, loaded `SuiteConfig`, and a payload dictionary (summaries, upgrade suggestions, etc.).
- Disable plugins globally via `extensions.enabled: false` or skip specific hooks with `extensions.disabled`.
- Provide ad-hoc plugins through `ISSUESUITE_PLUGINS="module:path_to_callable"` for experimentation.

## Telemetry (opt-in)

- Controlled through the `telemetry` block or `ISSUESUITE_TELEMETRY` environment variable.
- Events append to `${HOME}/.issuesuite/telemetry.jsonl` by default; override with `telemetry.store_path`.
- Each event captures timestamp, command, exit code, duration (ms), and IssueSuite version. Spec content is never recorded.
- Telemetry is ideal for monitoring adoption and spotting long-running operations.

## Upgrade assistant

`issuesuite upgrade` reviews configuration defaults and surfaces actionable recommendations:

- Suggests migrating legacy mapping files to `.issuesuite/index.json`.
- Encourages enabling telemetry where appropriate.
- Flags disabled extensions so teams can revisit overrides.

:::tip[Planned features]
We plan to emit telemetry dashboards directly in Starlight once GitHub Projects automation lands, enabling daily snapshots without manual exports.
:::

Integrate the command into CI to keep configurations aligned with new defaults and use telemetry payloads to instrument performance.
