IssueSuite follows the [Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr/) framework to keep documentation purposeful and scannable.

## Goals

- Provide a frictionless "Hello IssueSuite" journey via a single tutorial.
- Separate practitioner workflows from maintainer automation.
- Offer authoritative references for CLI commands and configuration keys.
- Capture design intent for long-lived architectural decisions.

## Structure

| Category      | Purpose                                                         |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tutorials     | Guided learning experiences for newcomers.                      |
| How-to guides | Task-oriented instructions for practitioners.                   |
| Reference     | Authoritative, factual resources (CLI, configuration, schemas). |
| Explanations  | Architectural context, design docs, and philosophy.             |

## Maintenance tips

- Keep tutorials linear — each step builds on the previous one without branching.
- Document new features with a how-to first, then add reference entries for new configuration keys.
- Place design decisions, trade-offs, and roadmap notes into explanations or ADRs.
- Update cross-links from the README and site navigation when adding pages.

:::caution[Planned features]
Documentation PRs will soon trigger preview builds with lighthouse checks so we can review UX quality before merging.
:::

Consult `docs/adrs/index.json` for architecture decision history and keep `Next Steps.md` aligned with documentation milestones.
