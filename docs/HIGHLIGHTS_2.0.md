**Impact:** 15-30 min onboarding, frequent parser errors  
**Solution:** Natural language ‚Üí spec conversion, interactive builder  
**Phase:** 1 (Q1 2026)

---

### 3. Transactional Sync with Rollback (GAP-RESIL-02)
**Severity:** HIGH | **Effort:** XL | **Priority:** P1

**Problem:** Partial failures leave inconsistent state  
**Impact:** Manual cleanup, difficult to reason about state  
**Solution:** All-or-nothing transactions with rollback capability  
**Phase:** 1 (Q1 2026)

---

### 4. Auto-Remediation of Drift (GAP-INTEL-02)
