## Gap Analysis by Dimension

### 1. Power & Scalability

#### GAP-SCALE-01: Multi-Repository Orchestration

**Severity:** HIGH | **Effort:** XL | **Priority:** P1

**Current State:**
IssueSuite operates on a single repository specified in config or via `--repo` flag.

**Gap:**
Organizations with 10+ repositories cannot efficiently manage roadmaps across products. Each repo requires separate config, sync runs, and monitoring.

**User Impact:**

- Platform teams managing microservices (5-50 repos) must run IssueSuite 50 times
- No unified view of cross-cutting initiatives
- Difficult to maintain consistency (labels, milestones, workflows)

**2.0 Vision:**

```yaml
# Workspace-level config
workspaces:
  - name: platform-core
    repos:
      - owner/auth-service
      - owner/api-gateway
      - owner/data-pipeline
    shared:
      labels: [platform, security]
      milestones: [Q1 2026, Q2 2026]
  - name: frontend
    repos:
      - owner/web-app
      - owner/mobile-app
    shared:
      labels: [ui, ux]
```

**Implementation Notes:**

- Add `WorkspaceConfig` abstraction
- Parallel sync across repos with unified summary
- Shared label/milestone preflight across workspace
- Workspace-level dry-run planning

---

#### GAP-SCALE-02: Issue Templates & Patterns

**Severity:** MEDIUM | **Effort:** M | **Priority:** P2

**Current State:**
Every issue spec is written from scratch. No reusable patterns or templates.

**Gap:**
Teams with repetitive issue types (security audits, quarterly reviews, onboarding tasks) duplicate YAML blocks.

**User Impact:**

- High cognitive load for routine issues
- Inconsistent issue structure across team
- Difficult to enforce organizational standards

**2.0 Vision:**

```markdown
## [slug: q1-security-audit]

\`\`\`yaml
template: security-quarterly-audit
variables:
quarter: Q1 2026
scope: [authentication, authorization]
\`\`\`

## Templates defined in config

templates:
security-quarterly-audit:
title: "{{quarter}} Security Audit: {{scope | join(', ')}}"
labels: [security, audit, quarterly]
body_template: | ## Scope
{% for area in scope %} - [ ] {{ area | title }}
{% endfor %}
```

**Implementation Notes:**

- Add Jinja2 templating support
- Template library in config or separate files
- Validation that variables match template schema
- CLI command to list/preview templates

---

#### GAP-SCALE-03: Bulk Operations & Batch Updates

**Severity:** MEDIUM | **Effort:** L | **Priority:** P2

**Current State:**
Operations are per-issue during sync. No way to batch-update all issues matching criteria.

**Gap:**
Cannot perform operations like "close all issues labeled 'wontfix'" or "add 'needs-triage' to all open issues without assignee."

**User Impact:**

- Manual bulk operations require GitHub UI or scripts
- No declarative way to express bulk transformations
- Difficult to implement policy-based updates

**2.0 Vision:**

```bash
# CLI bulk operations
issuesuite bulk --filter "state:open AND NOT assigned" --add-label needs-triage --dry-run

# Declarative rules in ISSUES.md
## [bulk-rule: auto-triage]
\`\`\`yaml
type: rule
condition: "state == 'open' AND assignee == null AND age_days > 7"
actions:
  - add_label: needs-triage
  - add_comment: "This issue needs triage. Please assign or close."
\`\`\`
```

**Implementation Notes:**

- Extend parser to recognize `type: rule` blocks
- Add filter/query language (subset of GitHub search syntax)
- Bulk operation engine with dry-run support
- Rate limiting awareness for large batches

---

### 2. User & Agent Experience

#### GAP-UX-01: AI-Assisted Spec Generation

**Severity:** HIGH | **Effort:** L | **Priority:** P1

**Current State:**
Users manually author YAML specs. AI agents must understand format from documentation.

**Gap:**

- New users face learning curve on spec format
- AI agents frequently generate invalid YAML
- No interactive spec builder

**User Impact:**

- Slower onboarding (15-30 min to first issue)
- Parser errors frustrate new users
- Agents require multiple iterations to get format right

**2.0 Vision:**

```bash
# Interactive spec builder
issuesuite create --interactive
? Title: Implement user authentication
? Labels: feature, backend, security
? Milestone: MVP
? Body: [opens $EDITOR with template]
✓ Generated spec in ISSUES.md

# AI assistant mode
issuesuite create --ai "Add an issue for implementing OAuth2 with GitHub provider"
✓ Generated spec with inferred labels, milestone, and detailed body

# Agent-friendly JSON input
echo '{"title":"...", "labels":["..."], ...}' | issuesuite create --json --append
```

**Implementation Notes:**

- Add `create` subcommand with interactive prompts
- Integrate LLM for natural language → spec conversion
- Schema-guided validation during creation
- Append mode for incremental additions

---

#### GAP-UX-02: Rich Diff Visualization

**Severity:** MEDIUM | **Effort:** M | **Priority:** P2

**Current State:**
Dry-run output shows text diffs, truncated body changes.

**Gap:**

- Body diffs truncated at 80 chars (configurable but still lossy)
- No side-by-side comparison
- Labels/milestones shown as lists, hard to see what changed

**User Impact:**

- Users must inspect raw ISSUES.md + live issue to understand full change
- Difficult to review large body updates
- No visual highlighting of key changes

**2.0 Vision:**

```bash
# HTML diff report
issuesuite sync --dry-run --diff-html diff-report.html
✓ Generated interactive HTML diff at diff-report.html

# Rich terminal output with inline diffs
issuesuite sync --dry-run --diff-full
Issue #42: Update API documentation
  Labels: + docs, + api  - draft
  Body:
    @@ -1,3 +1,5 @@
    +## Overview
    +This document covers the REST API.
     ## Endpoints
```

**Implementation Notes:**

- Add HTML template for diff visualization
- Use difflib for side-by-side diffs
- Color coding in terminal (added=green, removed=red)
- Optional full-body diff mode (override truncation)

---

#### GAP-UX-03: Interactive Conflict Resolution

**Severity:** MEDIUM | **Effort:** L | **Priority:** P2

**Current State:**
When reconciliation detects drift, user must manually edit ISSUES.md.

**Gap:**

- No guided workflow for resolving conflicts
- Users must understand both live state and spec
- Prone to errors in manual reconciliation

**User Impact:**

- Time-consuming to resolve drift (5-10 min per conflict)
- Risk of data loss if user overwrites wrong version
- No audit trail of reconciliation decisions

**2.0 Vision:**

```bash
issuesuite reconcile --interactive
Found 3 drifted issues:

[1/3] Issue #42: API Documentation
  Spec title:    "Update API docs"
  GitHub title:  "Update API documentation (REVISED)"

  Options:
  [1] Keep spec (update GitHub)
  [2] Keep GitHub (update spec)
  [3] Merge (edit in $EDITOR)
  [4] Skip
  Choice: 2
  ✓ Updated spec to match GitHub

# Auto-resolve rules
issuesuite reconcile --auto-resolve \
  --prefer-github-for labels \
  --prefer-spec-for milestone
```

**Implementation Notes:**

- Add interactive mode to reconcile command
- Implement 3-way merge for complex conflicts
- Auto-resolve rules in config
- Reconciliation audit log

---

### 3. Intelligence & Automation

#### GAP-INTEL-01: Smart Suggestions & Recommendations

**Severity:** HIGH | **Effort:** L | **Priority:** P1

**Current State:**
IssueSuite performs requested operations. No proactive suggestions.

**Gap:**

- Cannot recommend labels based on content
- No detection of duplicate/similar issues
- Missing milestone suggestions based on patterns

**User Impact:**

- Users must manually categorize every issue
- Duplicates created unintentionally
- Inconsistent labeling across team

**2.0 Vision:**

```bash
issuesuite analyze
Analyzing 47 issues...

Recommendations:
  [1] Issue 'implement-caching' is similar to closed #23 (85% match)
      → Consider referencing or reopening

  [2] Issue 'api-timeout' mentions performance but missing 'performance' label
      → Suggested labels: performance, reliability

  [3] 8 issues in 'Sprint 1' milestone but milestone due date passed
      → Consider moving to 'Sprint 2' or closing

Apply all suggestions? [y/N]: y
✓ Applied 3 recommendations
```

**Implementation Notes:**

- Text similarity analysis (TF-IDF, embeddings)
- Label prediction based on issue content
- Milestone health checks
- ML model training on historical issues (optional)

---

#### GAP-INTEL-02: Auto-Remediation of Drift

**Severity:** HIGH | **Effort:** M | **Priority:** P1

**Current State:**
Reconciliation detects drift but requires manual resolution.

**Gap:**

- Users must run reconcile, review output, edit specs, sync
- No automatic correction of simple drifts
- Drift accumulates if not checked regularly

**User Impact:**

- Drift management is reactive, not proactive
- Small drifts (typo fixes, label additions) require manual work
- Risk of specs becoming stale if team forgets reconcile

**2.0 Vision:**

```yaml
# Auto-remediation rules in config
auto_remediate:
  enabled: true
  rules:
    - name: pull-label-additions
      condition: labels_added_on_github
      action: add_to_spec
      require_approval: false

    - name: pull-typo-fixes
      condition: body_changed AND similarity > 0.95
      action: update_spec
      require_approval: false

    - name: push-milestone-changes
      condition: milestone_changed_in_spec
      action: update_github
      require_approval: true
```

**Implementation Notes:**

- Rule engine for auto-remediation
- Safety checks (require_approval flag)
- Dry-run mode for auto-remediation
- Audit trail of automatic changes

---

#### GAP-INTEL-03: Semantic Validation

**Severity:** MEDIUM | **Effort:** L | **Priority:** P2

**Current State:**
Validation checks syntax (slug pattern, YAML structure). No semantic checks.

**Gap:**

- Cannot detect logical inconsistencies
- No validation of references between issues
- Missing checks for required fields based on issue type

**User Impact:**

- Issues created with incomplete information
- Broken references to milestones/issues
- Inconsistent issue structure

**2.0 Vision:**

```bash
issuesuite validate --semantic
Running semantic validation...

Errors:
  ✗ Issue 'feature-x' references milestone 'MVP' which doesn't exist
  ✗ Issue 'bug-fix-123' marked as closed but no resolution comment

Warnings:
  ⚠ Issue 'refactor-db' has no estimate/effort label
  ⚠ Issue 'security-audit' lacks security checklist

Info:
  ℹ 3 issues reference each other (potential circular dependency)
```

**Implementation Notes:**

- Semantic rule engine with pluggable checks
- Cross-reference validation (milestones, labels, issues)
- Issue type schemas (bug, feature, epic with required fields)
- Configurable warning/error levels

---

### 4. Resilience & Robustness

#### GAP-RESIL-01: Advanced Retry Strategies

**Severity:** MEDIUM | **Effort:** M | **Priority:** P2

**Current State:**
Centralized retry with exponential backoff. Single strategy for all operations.

**Gap:**

- No operation-specific retry policies
- Cannot customize backoff per error type
- No circuit breaker for persistent failures

**User Impact:**

- Slow failures (retries exhaust even when service is down)
- Over-aggressive retries can hit abuse limits
- No graceful degradation

**2.0 Vision:**

```yaml
retry:
  strategies:
    rate_limit:
      max_attempts: 5
      backoff: exponential
      backoff_base: 2
      max_sleep: 300
      respect_retry_after: true

    network:
      max_attempts: 3
      backoff: exponential
      backoff_base: 1.5
      max_sleep: 60

    abuse:
      max_attempts: 2
      backoff: linear
      circuit_breaker:
        failure_threshold: 3
        reset_timeout: 3600
```

**Implementation Notes:**

- Strategy registry mapping error categories to policies
- Circuit breaker pattern for abuse detection
- Adaptive backoff based on response headers
- Per-operation retry budgets

---

#### GAP-RESIL-02: Transaction Rollback

**Severity:** HIGH | **Effort:** XL | **Priority:** P1

**Current State:**
Sync operations are applied sequentially. Partial failure leaves inconsistent state.

**Gap:**

- If sync fails midway (e.g., rate limit), some issues updated, others not
- No atomic "all or nothing" mode
- Cannot rollback on validation failure

**User Impact:**

- Manual cleanup required after partial failures
- Difficult to reason about system state
- Risk of duplicate issues if retry from unclear state

**2.0 Vision:**

```bash
# Transactional mode
issuesuite sync --transactional --dry-run
Planning transactional sync...
✓ Pre-flight checks passed
✓ All operations validated
✓ Transaction log prepared

issuesuite sync --transactional --apply
Executing transaction...
[▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓] 10/10 operations completed
✓ Transaction committed

# Rollback capability
issuesuite rollback --last
Rolling back last sync (transaction #42)...
✓ Reverted 8 issue updates
✓ Rolled back 2 issue creations
```

**Implementation Notes:**

- Transaction log of planned operations
- Operation sequencing with checkpoints
- Rollback planner (reverses creates, restores updates)
- GitHub API limitations (no native transactions, best effort)

---

#### GAP-RESIL-03: Disaster Recovery & Backup

**Severity:** MEDIUM | **Effort:** M | **Priority:** P2

**Current State:**
Mapping files (.issuesuite/index.json) persist slug→number mapping. No versioning.

**Gap:**

- No backup of historical state
- Cannot recover from corrupted mapping
- No point-in-time restore

**User Impact:**

- If mapping corrupted, must manually reconcile or rebuild
- No audit trail of historical sync operations
- Cannot answer "what changed last week?"

**2.0 Vision:**

```bash
# Automatic backups
issuesuite sync --backup-before
✓ Created backup: .issuesuite/backups/2026-01-15-1430-pre-sync.tar.gz

# Restore from backup
issuesuite restore --from .issuesuite/backups/2026-01-15-1430-pre-sync.tar.gz
Restoring from backup...
✓ Restored mapping (47 issues)
✓ Restored hash state

# History browser
issuesuite history --days 7
2026-01-15 14:30 - sync: 3 updated, 1 closed
2026-01-14 10:15 - sync: 2 created, 5 updated
2026-01-13 16:45 - reconcile: 2 drift detected
```

**Implementation Notes:**

- Versioned mapping files with timestamps
- Tar/zip backup of .issuesuite directory
- Operation history log (append-only)
- Restore command with safety checks

---

- No estimation of sync duration for large roadmaps
- Missing trend analysis (velocity, label distribution)

**User Impact:**

- No early warning for roadmap risks
- Surprised by long sync times
- Difficult to measure team productivity

**2.0 Vision:**

```bash
issuesuite predict
Analyzing trends...

Milestone Forecast:
  Sprint 1 (due in 5 days)
    ✓ On track (8/10 issues closed, 80% velocity)

  MVP (due in 30 days)
    ⚠ At risk (15/50 issues closed, 30% complete)
    Prediction: Will finish in ~50 days (20 days late)

Recommendations:
  - Consider descoping 10 issues from MVP
  - Team velocity trending down (-15% over 2 weeks)
```

**Implementation Notes:**

- Time-series analysis of issue closure rates
- Velocity tracking per milestone/label
- ML regression for completion prediction
- Risk scoring algorithm

---

#### GAP-PROACT-02: Guided Workflows & Wizards

## Red Team Assessment

### Attack Vectors & Edge Cases

#### RT-2.0-01: Workspace Privilege Escalation

**Severity:** HIGH | **Category:** Multi-repo security

**Attack Vector:**
If workspace config allows specifying arbitrary repos, attacker could add repos they shouldn't manage.

**Scenario:**

```yaml
workspaces:
  - name: my-workspace
    repos:
      - victim-org/sensitive-repo # Attacker adds
```

**Mitigation:**

- Workspace validation against GitHub org membership
- Require explicit approval for new repos
- CODEOWNERS-style permissions for workspace config

---

#### RT-2.0-02: Plugin Supply Chain Attack

**Severity:** CRITICAL | **Category:** Extensibility security

**Attack Vector:**
Malicious plugin installed from marketplace could steal credentials or corrupt data.

**Scenario:**

```bash
issuesuite plugins install malicious-plugin
# Plugin code:
# os.environ['GITHUB_TOKEN'] -> exfiltrate
```

**Mitigation:**

- Plugin sandboxing (no direct env access)
- Plugin signing and verification
- Security audit of marketplace submissions
- Capability-based security model

---

#### RT-2.0-03: Webhook Replay Attack

**Severity:** MEDIUM | **Category:** Server mode security

**Attack Vector:**
Attacker captures valid webhook payload and replays it multiple times.

**Scenario:**

```bash
# Captured webhook payload
curl -X POST https://issuesuite.com/webhook \
  -H "X-Hub-Signature-256: sha256=..." \
  -d '{"action":"closed","issue":{"number":42}}'
# Replayed 1000 times -> triggers 1000 sync operations
```

**Mitigation:**

- Nonce/timestamp validation
- Idempotency tokens
- Rate limiting per event type
- Delivery ID tracking

---

#### RT-2.0-04: Auto-Remediation Loop

**Severity:** MEDIUM | **Category:** Intelligence edge case

**Attack Vector:**
Auto-remediation rules create infinite update loops.

**Scenario:**

```yaml
# Rule 1: If GitHub adds label, sync to spec
# Rule 2: If spec changes, update GitHub
# → Infinite loop if rules conflict
```

**Mitigation:**

- Loop detection (max iterations per sync)
- Dry-run validation of rule conflicts
- Rule priority and sequencing
- Change attribution tracking

#### RT-2.0-05: Transaction Deadlock

**Severity:** LOW | **Category:** Resilience edge case

**Attack Vector:**
Concurrent transactions on same issues cause deadlock.

**Scenario:**

```bash
# Process A: Update issue #42, #43
# Process B: Update issue #43, #42
# → Deadlock if locking order differs
```

**Mitigation:**

- Deterministic lock ordering (by issue number)
- Transaction timeout and rollback
- Advisory locks at workspace level
- Detect and break deadlocks

## IssueSuite 2.0 Vision

### Core Pillars

#### 1. **Workspace-Native Architecture**

Multi-repository orchestration as a first-class concept. Manage 1-1000 repos from unified configuration with shared resources and cross-repo operations.

#### 2. **AI-First Workflows**

Every operation enhanced by intelligence: spec generation from natural language, smart suggestions, auto-remediation, predictive analytics.

#### 3. **Server-Mode Operations**

Persistent service with webhooks, REST API, and dashboard. IssueSuite as infrastructure, not just CLI tool.

#### 4. **Resilient by Default**

Transactional sync, circuit breakers, disaster recovery, adaptive retries. Production-grade reliability.

#### 5. **Plugin Ecosystem**

Vibrant marketplace of integrations (Jira, Linear, Notion, Slack, etc.) with sandboxed execution.

### Target Personas

#### Platform Engineer (Large Org)

- Manages 50+ microservices
- Needs: Multi-repo orchestration, audit trails, access controls
- Pain: Manual coordination across teams

#### Engineering Manager (Mid-Sized Team)

- Oversees 2-3 products (5-10 repos)
- Needs: Predictive analytics, milestone tracking, status reports
- Pain: Spreadsheet-based project tracking

#### Solo Developer / Small Team
