## 🚦 Recommendation

### ✅ **PROCEED** with Phase 1 Pilot

**Rationale:**
1. Strong v1.x foundation (production-ready, zero tech debt)
2. Clear gaps with validated user pain points
3. Feasible 15-month roadmap with manageable scope
4. Positive ROI with conservative estimates
5. Low-risk pilot approach (can pivot after 3 months)

**Next Steps:**
1. Community RFC (share vision, gather feedback)
2. Early adopter recruitment (10-15 alpha participants)
3. Architectural spike (webhook/API prototype)
4. Secure funding/staffing (3 engineers for Phase 1)
5. Kickoff Phase 1 development (Q1 2026)
