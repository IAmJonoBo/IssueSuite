## Why Archive?

These documents were valuable during development but represent:
- Completed work (implementation summaries, gap analyses)
- Point-in-time reports (security assessments, quality baselines)
- Internal communications (announcements, briefings)
- Draft blueprints not yet part of the release

Archiving keeps the documentation focused on current, actionable information for users and contributors while preserving historical context.
