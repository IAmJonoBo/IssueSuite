# Documentation Optimization - Before & After

## Overview

This document provides a visual comparison of the documentation improvements made to IssueSuite.

## 1. Documentation Organization

### Before

```
docs/
├── IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md (in-dev tracking)
├── gap_analysis.md (old)
├── gap_analysis_2025.md (completed)
├── baseline_report.md (point-in-time)
├── red_team_report.md (point-in-time)
├── internal_comms_security_workflow.md (internal)
├── governance/frontier_apex.md (draft blueprint)
├── README.md
├── RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md
├── adrs/ (current)
└── starlight/ (current)

Root/
├── Spark_Brief.md (implementation guide)
├── Next Steps.md (duplicate)
└── Next_Steps.md (current)
```

**Issues:**

- Mixed current and legacy documentation
- Development tracking mixed with user docs
- Duplicate files (Next Steps)
- No clear archive strategy

### After

```

    Parser->>Core: Issue specs
    Core->>GitHub: Fetch live issues
    Core->>Core: Compute diff
    Core->>Orchestrator: Execute plan
    Orchestrator->>Files: Persist artifacts
```

#### Additional Diagrams Added:
