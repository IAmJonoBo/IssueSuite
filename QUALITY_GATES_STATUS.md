## Recommendations for Achieving 85%+ Coverage

### High-Priority Areas

#### 1. CLI Module (cli.py) - 73% → 90%
**Uncovered areas:**
- Lines 416-435, 439-449: Command-line argument parsing edge cases
- Lines 501-517: Error handling for invalid configs
- Lines 600-622, 629-635: Agent update workflows
- Lines 689-734: Projects sync command paths
- Lines 1207-1259: Advanced CLI options and flags

**Recommended approach:**
- Add integration tests for each CLI subcommand
- Test error cases (missing files, invalid YAML, network failures)
- Mock file system operations for reproducibility
- Estimated effort: 20-25 test cases

#### 2. Core Module (core.py) - 67% → 90%
**Uncovered areas:**
- Lines 62-68, 73-74: Issue spec validation edge cases
- Lines 102-125: Preflight resource creation
- Lines 397-414, 424-432: Issue update logic variations
- Lines 626-652, 662-675: Label and milestone synchronization
- Lines 748-759, 784, 787-790: Error recovery paths

**Recommended approach:**
- Add tests for complex sync scenarios (multiple issues with conflicts)
- Test preflight with various permission levels
- Test dry-run vs. apply mode differences
- Mock GitHub API responses for edge cases
- Estimated effort: 25-30 test cases

#### 3. GitHub Issues Module (github_issues.py) - 62% → 90%
**Uncovered areas:**
- Lines 84-88, 110-111: Authentication variations
- Lines 171-180, 195-196: Issue creation edge cases
- Lines 206-244: Issue update with various field combinations
- Lines 274, 284, 288: Error handling paths
- Lines 307-325: Milestone resolution failures

**Recommended approach:**
- Add mocked HTTP tests for all GitHub API calls
- Test authentication failures and retries
- Test rate limiting scenarios
- Test partial failures (some issues succeed, others fail)
- Estimated effort: 20-25 test cases

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Phase 1: Quick Wins (1-2 days)**
   - Add simple CLI subcommand tests
   - Add basic core module sync tests
   - Target: +5% overall coverage

2. **Phase 2: Core Logic (2-3 days)**
   - Comprehensive core module tests
   - Error handling and edge cases
   - Target: +5% overall coverage

3. **Phase 3: Integration (2-3 days)**
   - CLI integration tests
   - GitHub API mock tests
   - End-to-end scenarios
   - Target: +5% overall coverage, reach 95% in critical modules

### Testing Best Practices

1. **Use Test Fixtures**: Create reusable fixtures for common scenarios
2. **Mock External Dependencies**: GitHub API, file system, environment variables
3. **Test Error Paths**: Not just happy paths
4. **Parameterize Tests**: Use pytest.mark.parametrize for variations
5. **Focus on Business Logic**: Prioritize high-value code paths

## Quality Gate Configuration

Current thresholds in `scripts/quality_gates.py`:
```python
CRITICAL_MODULE_THRESHOLDS = {
    "issuesuite/cli.py": 90.0,
    "issuesuite/core.py": 90.0,
    "issuesuite/github_issues.py": 90.0,
    "issuesuite/project.py": 90.0,
    "issuesuite/pip_audit_integration.py": 90.0,
}
```

Overall coverage threshold: 85.0%

## Continuous Improvement

To maintain and improve coverage:

1. **CI Enforcement**: Quality gates run on every PR
2. **Coverage Reports**: Generated in CI artifacts
3. **Trend Tracking**: Monitor coverage over time via `coverage_trends.json`
4. **Documentation**: Update test documentation as coverage improves
5. **Review Process**: Require coverage maintenance in code reviews

## Conclusion

Significant progress has been made toward achieving all green badges:
- **15 new tests** added (355 total, up from 340)
- **2 percentage points** overall coverage improvement
- **2 of 5 critical modules** now exceed 90% target
- **All linting, formatting, type checking, and doc builds** pass

The remaining work focuses on adding targeted tests for the three largest modules (cli, core, github_issues) to reach the 85% overall and 90% per-module thresholds. The recommended approach above provides a clear path to achieving these goals.
