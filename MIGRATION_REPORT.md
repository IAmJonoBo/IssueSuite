# Starlight Singularity-Style Theme Implementation

## Summary

Successfully implemented a complete Singularity-inspired design system for the IssueSuite Starlight documentation site, following the specification from `FULLY_IMPLEMENT_CHECK_THEN_DELETE.md`.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dependencies Added

- `@astrojs/sitemap@^3.2.2` - Automatic sitemap generation

### 2. Configuration Updates

#### `astro.config.mjs`

- Added sitemap integration
- Added Google Fonts preconnect and stylesheet links
  - Inter (weights: 400, 500, 600)
  - Space Grotesk (weights: 500, 600, 700)
- Updated customCss to include both `tokens.css` and `theme.css`
- Added empty `redirects` object for future URL mapping

### 3. Design System Implementation

#### `src/styles/tokens.css` (New)

Comprehensive design token system including:

- **Typography**: Font families (Inter, Space Grotesk, monospace)
- **Type Scale**: Responsive sizes from h1 to small text with line heights
- **Colors**: High-contrast neutrals (ink-900/700/500, bg-0/50/100) and cobalt/indigo accents (accent-600/700)
- **Spacing**: 8-step scale from 4px to 64px (s-1 through s-8)
- **Radii**: Border radius values (r-1: 8px, r-2: 12px, r-pill: 999px)
- **Shadows**: Card and header shadows
- **Layout**: Max container width (1280px) and responsive gutters

#### `src/styles/theme.css` (Replaced)

Complete Singularity-style theme featuring:

- Space Grotesk for headings, Inter for body text
- High-contrast color scheme
- Accessible focus states (2px solid accent outline)
- Responsive container system
- Card component styles with hover effects
- Article/prose typography
- Sticky header with shadow
- Newsletter-style CTA callout blocks
- Reduced motion support

### 4. Components

#### `src/components/CardGrid.astro` (New)

Responsive card grid component:

- 1 column on mobile
- 2 columns on tablet (≥768px)
- 3 columns on desktop (≥1024px)
- Supports title and description props
- Integrated with design tokens

### 5. Build Artifacts

Verified successful generation of:

- `sitemap-index.xml` - Sitemap index
- `sitemap-0.xml` - Sitemap entries
- `robots.txt` - Search engine directives
- Font loading in HTML output
- Compiled CSS with all design tokens

## Verification

All requirements from the specification have been verified:

✅ Package dependencies (Astro, Starlight, MDX, Sitemap)
✅ Font imports (Google Fonts with Inter + Space Grotesk)
✅ Design tokens implementation (typography, colors, spacing, layout)
✅ Theme implementation (Singularity-style with accessibility)
✅ Component creation (CardGrid)
✅ Build verification (successful compilation, sitemap, robots.txt)
✅ Accessibility features (contrast, focus, reduced motion)

## GitHub Pages Deployment

The existing `docs.yml` workflow already handles GitHub Pages deployment with:

- Build from `docs/starlight` directory
- Deploy to GitHub Pages
- Proper permissions configuration

## Notes

- The existing documentation structure is maintained
- Current `index.mdx` uses splash template, which is appropriate for the landing page
- No redirects needed as URL structure hasn't changed
- `docs.yml` workflow is more sophisticated than the spec's `pages.yml` (uses nox build system)

## Testing

```bash
cd docs/starlight
npm ci
npm run build  # ✓ Successful
```

All 17 pages built successfully with sitemap generation confirmed.
